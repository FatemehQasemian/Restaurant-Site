# Restaurant-Site
I worked on one of the most popular ways of serving up data to a website (Ajax), learnt about the protocol that the language of the web speaks (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses as well as how to process JSON data. I finished the module by connecting my restaurant website to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page.

This is my site: https://fatemehqasemian.github.io/Restaurant-Site/
